# The Crowd Relief App for Covid19

Crowd Relief ​ has been created to help coordinate efforts to distribute resources amongst people in need during the current lockdown. The main functionalities of the map are listed below:

- Mark out points on a map where relief needs to be provided (relief points)
- Mark out points where resources are available (contribution points)
- Edit relief point to keep track of resources needed in a particular area
- Provide details about how much relief is delivered or how many items you have to contribute

With this information, it will become easier for the people coordinating the relief operations to keep track of where resources need to go. The map will show resource availability and relief requirements wherever they have been marked by relief workers on the field. The markers are crowd-sourced by whoever is using the app. This will enable agencies to quickly know where there is a need and be able to redirect resources to those locations.
